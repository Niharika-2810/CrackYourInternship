# CrackYourInternship
I am starting a 45-day coding challenge by Arsh Goyal today and will continue to post my progress.
This challenge is designed to test your skills in Data structures and algorithms. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this is a great opportunity to:
Sharpen your coding skills: The challenge will present you with interesting problems to solve, helping you improve your problem-solving abilities and coding proficiency.
Learn new things: You might encounter new concepts or techniques while tackling the challenges, expanding your coding knowledge.
Compete with your peers: Put your skills to the test and see how you fare against other developers.
